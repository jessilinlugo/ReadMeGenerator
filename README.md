Node.js is just a program that runs Javascript outside the browser, but for some reason the refresher on JS as a whole was as welcome as a glass of water on a hot summer day. Javascript felt like a new language I'd learned that I wasn't able to speak, until now. 

Starting this homework was suprisingly difficult, only because I doubted myself immensely after having struggled with JS so much, I felt 'It can't possibly be this easy'. Thankfully, I am in a class with a bunch of wonderful people who were able to guide me in the right direction.

I began by setting up the required packages for installation. Inquirer is a package that allows users to obtain and store information. With this package, I'm able to ask questions and store the answers for later. 

After the questions are completed, there is a function to create the text file, and a separate function to populate the file with the user inputted information. 

Overall, this assignment was exactly the type of break my brain needed, something useful but simple and achievable. 

Now, I'm ready to tackle constructor functions and object oriented programming head-on.
